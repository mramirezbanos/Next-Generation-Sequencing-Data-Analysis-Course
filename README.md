# Next-Generation-Sequencing-Data-Analysis-Course
Final Report for the PhD-Certified Course Project: Next-Generation Sequencing Data Analysis, held at the 
Bioinformatics Research Centre, Aarhus University, from 23 June to 27 June, 2025.
The course comprised preparatory work, including paper readings and the production of a poster presentation of own research (40 hours), 45 hours of lectures and exercises during the course week, and a  5-10 page report (35 hours). In total, the course entailed 120 hours of work, equivalent to 5 ECTS credits
## Course description
The course included lectures introducing students to the most important sequencing technologies (longread and short-read) and ChIP-seq, genetic mapping, metagenomics, comparative genomics, mapping of reads, de novo assembly, visualisation of NGS data, quality control, SNP calling and structural variation calling, RNAseq analysis and single cell RNA analysis using both R and Python in Jupyter notebooks. 
Paper reading further introduced students to some of the main applications of NGS data, and a dedicated poster session was used for discussion of own NGS related research.
The practical exercises introduced the students to the GALAXY platform and Jupyter notebooks for handling data and analyzing all the above aspects of NGS data using real data sets as well as their own data when available.
